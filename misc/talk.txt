talk:

Last time:
	Normal noise
	PCA
	Fast point features

	Tried region growing approach

	This was like swinging at a pinata in the dark

Architecture was colapsing under the weight of its complexity

	Premature opitimsation
	Data structures were designed to work on both the cpu and gpu
	Not ideal for cpu or gpu
	Works well with pcl

Refactor
	Sparse representation
	Index grid to reconstruct when saving or when necessarry

	Layers represented with sets of point labels

	This results in approximately constant space per layer

	Makes set operations easy and cheap
		Good for using more than one tool to identify an object
		Good for comparing methods

	Still allows points to be part of more than one layer

	Nice alpha blending

Problem with workflow
	Used to be:
		1. Code
		2. Compile (2-5 minutes)
		4. Start program
		5. Load point cloud (+-1min)
		6. Set up state (+-1min)
		7. Test
		8. Bug. goto 1


	Now:
		1. Code
		2. Compile plugin (1 minute)
		3. Test
		4. If bug, goto 1

So key to undertanding whats going on is visualisation.
	There is simply too much data to eyeball numerically

	2D vis 3d visualisation

	I visualised the graph cut but this was not of much use.


	Visualising

		PCA
			Explanation
				For a neigbourhood of points, calculate the primary axis along which the points vary
				Covariance matrix and eigen value decomposition
				You get 3 eigen vectors that represent the 3 primary axis
				Also get 3 eigen values that represent to what degree point vary along a given axis

				Its a good idea to sort the eigen values

				The absolute eigen values do not really matter?
				Its the values relative to the others

			Cost
				Search
					KDtree vs Grid search

			Parameters
				Neighbours
				Normalisation of eigen values

		Normals
			Stdev
			Colours

		Sobel filter
			

Is gridsearch faster?
