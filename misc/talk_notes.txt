Point cloud is the data that is returned from laser scanners

Shoots out a laser and captures x, y z coordinates that represent the objects scanned.

I'm trying to remove the points that correspond to trees, shrubs and grass.

Aim of zamani project is to digitally preserve cultural heritage sites

Fly around africa and use laser scanners document culturally significant sites such as castles, monuments, old temples, essentially touristy places.

---

Move laser scanners around to document every bit of the site, they also take panoramic pictures

---

All this feeds in to a pipeline

---

Point cloud cleaning is performed by software but has various levels of user interfevnetion.

Very manual process, takes long
