Hi My name is rick and the next 10 minutes will be all about my masters project.

Im this presentation i tell you what I'm doing, why I'm doing it and, how I'm doing it.

What am I doing?
I'm attempting to remove plants from 3d laser scans.
Do it fast and accurately.

Why am I doing this?
The people over at the zamani project are having a hard time doing this with existing tools.
All types of noise is problematic but vegatation is the most problematic.
Isolated 
What is wrong existing software
 
How am I doing this?
Create a point cloud cleaner to remove this.
Pont cloud cleaner is a framework to test existing algorithms and create new ones, combine them in new ways, incorporate human input.

All algorithms are implemented in plugins. Makes things more managable. Idea shamelessly stolen from meshlab.

Augmented aproach is taken because its higly unlikely that fully automated approaches will work.
