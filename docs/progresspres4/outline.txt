Background

Point cloud cleaning is tedious
up to 2 hours per scan
manual task

The aim is to speed this up

Existing systems

Black boxes so hard to build on
Good things in there

Lasso, brush, plane select, power line select

Tools lie on a continuem of high area of influence, low area of influence

High area of influence are more automated less precise
Low area of influence are less automated but more precise

When a tool is not 100% accurate, remdial action will always be required

Cleaning time = sum of the times to apply each action + overhead

a tool that is benficial needs to reduce the overall cleaning time


But we cannot build on proprietary systens

We need a basic framework to build on

Requirements
