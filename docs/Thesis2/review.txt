Distoinguish between range scan / depth map and pointcloud

Drill down into details for methods that I select

Background:
	Main features
	Who has used them

	Stuff i dont use:
		Show that I've read about it an the implications


Say what an edge is:
	Mention different methods
	Choose one that is a primary one that I focus on.

Segmentation:
	image based
	feature based

High level discussinon of features:
	What we need to segment something


Details in later chapters


Design:
	More details on the methods


End of teh chapter:
	Come up with a bunch of methods that should be considered


System chapter


Comparison of segmentation methods:
	Use fair poor and average
	Suitability
	Cost
	Paralisable
	User control
		Environment is complex
		Set user constraint
	Parameters determination
	Extent to which user needs to provide information/ level of interaction required.
	Argue in favour guided segmentation

Features & Methods	

Deal with scanner perculiarities:



Refer to existing systems in when decribing why you cant use stuff of the shelf
	Also during system design


What is background
What work has being done
Use range image instead of pointcloud
General point cloud schemes

Characteristics of depth maps of lidar vs other

How to deal with irregularities in range scans

Need to point out canopy segmentation
Dismis methods

Literature review discuss all the methods

At the end you have a taxonomy


Textbook level overview
then go into lietarture
delay complicated detail discussion for specific chapter


Inroduction
	How its ganne be layed out
	Noise and atrifacts
	Types of images and how they differ
		Hergitage scenes vs normal scenes
		More natural scenes vs Artificail city scenes

	Segmentation
		Compact and reasonably comprehensive
		Broad stoke segmentation
		Machine learning
		Classes of segmentation methotds
		Which things are relevant
		Describe features


	Survey of existing work
	Algoritms to segment images... 2d 3d and rage scans
		Range scans, point clouds, natural scenes, artificial schenes
		Properties
		Samples are sparse
		Appaorach does this
			Tempted to do that
			However problems

End with taxonomy:
	This is what we have determined

Add a images to describe data
