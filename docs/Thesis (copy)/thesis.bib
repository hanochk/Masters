annote = {Range scanning involves two streams of processing. Geometry and surface appearance. Data between the two streams may be exchanged to improve quality and efficiency. In the end bith are combined inti a single description.
        
Hardware:
Can be considered a black box that produces cloud points. Scanner characteristic can be exploited however.
        
- Triangulation systems. Project light that is captured by a sensor. 3d positios are then calculated. Limitations: Line of sign between light source and sensor, surface properties.
        
-Time-of-flight. Round trip time for emited light to reflect. Allows for real time scanning, large distances (100m).
        
-Need to know about scanner:
Accuracy (how much error, error increases with distance), Precision varies accross the range image
        
- Resolution, Smallest distance between two points.
        
-Implicit information: No occluding surfaces along the ray. Range images are 2d arrays. Estimated surface normal can be calculated bu using the cross product from a point to its immediate neighbours. This helps to construct a surface more efficiently.
        
Registration:
Acurate tracking of orientation and position, turntabke (self occlusions, top and bottom problematic), interactive allignment (identify 3 points to calcuate rigid transform), hard to solve with no information (large parameter search space),
        
ICP used to refine initial allignment. It was proved that ICP converges at a local minimum, but may not find global minimum.
        
Surfaces with few features are problematic, Two cylindrical surfaces my slide without distance between correspondences changing. Intensity or coacquired texture images may help with this.
        
Identifying correspondence points may vary. Euclidian distance, point to plane (less sensitive to non uniform sampling, allows smooth surfaces to slide), point to projection.
        
Point on the first surface can be uniformly subsampled, or seleted by identifying surface features.
        
Zang filters pairings by using a maximum tollerable distance and orientation consistency.
        
Dorai checks error variance bewteen neigbouring points to prune incompatible matches.
        
Compute the rotation matrix. This is a non linear minimisation problem? (cannot be solved in closed form, [be sure what this means]). This can be solved by linearising the rotation matrix by using small rotations. Also Quarterions and SVG.
        
Multiple registration:
Pair wise errors accumulate = bad.
Skeleton and align other to it.
        
One view selected as main. Othe views registered to it. Itterated until incremental views are stable in terms of their incremental roattion matrix
        
Does pairwise resgistartion. Bad correspondences are then discarded. All the scans are then itterated over to distrute the error in overlapping scans within some threshold.
        
Simultanious registration takes bloody long. can be optimised with a resolution heirarchy.
        
Using textures to aid registration:
Coincidently captured. Texture can be registered to the range image. Textures can add features and be of higher resolution. Can be projected onto the geometric model.
        
Texture can be used to assist operator with initial allignment.
        
Automatic initial allignment by using 2d image features.
        
Texture used to refine allignment. Good when raster image has higher resolution. Colours are used as coordinates or matching operations are used.
        
Line of sight error:
Elipsoid gaussian error produced by scanner, Outliers produced by reflections and such. Depth error is the primary concern.
        
Better statistical reconsruction from two estimates. Overlapping data resampled.
        
Scan integration:
Merge alligned scans into a non redundant representation.
        
Problems: Noisy data, outliers, missing sections, variations in sampling density
        
Range scans vs point clouds
        
Delaunay-based methods assume no structure and uses a convex hull type operation to extract a surface. Sensitive to noise.
        
Surface based methods:
        
Greedy approach, local parameterisation
        
Zippering: mesh range scans and then remove redundant traingles
        
Ball pivoting, 2d delauney upgarded to 3d
        
Surface based methods are efficient but robustness issues arise with noise
        
Volumetric Methods: 
Calulate 3d grid with distances to the surface. Find zero set. 
        
Voxel to surface distance along ray. Voxel to closest point on consensus surface (average surface)
        
Distance to delaunay traingulation. 
        
Good for large data sets apparently. Voxel size need to be optimally selected. Memory use need to be taken into account. Octree instead of regular grid could help. Good for water tight models as it tends to fill holes.
        
Deformable surfaces: Initial approximation \& relaxation
        
Solid model such as a circle with virtual springs
        
Post processing:
        
Addapt final model after intergration.
        
Mesh simplification: reduce complexity
        
Texturise. Parameterize surface with respect to 2nd surface. Use mid mapping
        
Texture:
Colour is percieved by humans depending on illumnatiion
Finish is a product of the objects reflective properties
        
Register texture by generating synthetic binary image by projecting it to guessed camera position. Improve guess by minimising error.

abstract = {After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push-relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

-------
Find vegetation
        
Algorithm
---------------
Segment regions of interest that contain a high about on muliple echos
        
For segmented regions shape description features are calculated smallest eigenvalue is below 0.05 or the ratio of the smallest is below 0.01 the cluster is labeled non-vegetation.
        
Regions are afterwards classified according to the features into vegetation and non-vegetation
        
post-processing: remove large planar surfaces
        
Detail:
---------
Cloud leveled on ground plane (Inclinometer used)
Binary occupancy grid produced
Occupancy set if it has first eccos (tree heuristic)
Segments identified with two pass algorithm
   One: label pixel with neigbour's label
   Two: ensure lable the same as connected component
        
Ideally segment at 10cm resolution with this scanner.
Problem due to the size of registered dataset.
        
Multi resolution clustering: segments that could be trees are converted to a finer resolution and segmented! (NICE)
        
Classifier
--------------
SVM
        
Features
-------------
Inspired by Reitberger et al. [4],
        
Histogram of point densities (10cm horisontal slices)
Histogram is a shape desciptor of a tree
        
Histogram of eigenvalues. Smallest eigen value is an estimator of planarity.
Trees should be volumetric
        
Alternative fast classifier is the ratio of the two smallest eigenvalues. Rough class predictor.
        
We therefore classify segments using two threshold. If the ratio of second
        
Results
-----------
        
Background:
------------------
If you only want to model or mesh the house, the trees are are in the way
        
RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner is not a common scanner. it does Full-waveform-analysis. It performs multiple range meaurements.
        
Pulse often hit muliple surfaces on edges of structures and on trees and vegetation.
        
Stdev for a measurement helps to detect moving things.},

abstract = {Feature extraction is a central step of processing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. Existing detectors tend to exploit characteristics of specific environments: corners and lines from indoor (rectilinear) environments, and trees from outdoor environments. While these detectors work well in their intended environments, their performance in different environments can be poor. We describe a general purpose feature detector for both 2D and 3D LIDAR data that is applicable to virtually any environment. Our method adapts classic feature detection methods from the image processing literature, specifically the multi-scale Kanade-Tomasi corner detector. The resulting method is capable of identifying highly stable and repeatable features at a variety of spatial scales without knowledge of environment, and produces principled uncertainty estimates and corner descriptors at same time. We present results on both software simulation and standard datasets, including the 2D Victoria Park and Intel Research Center datasets, and the 3D MIT DARPA Urban Challenge dataset.},

Neighbourhood graph is set up by joining clusters for which one of its points have another cluster's points in its k=5 nearest neighbours. Neighbouring clusters are then merged based on a normal cone metric of the union of two neighbours. It is a bit more relaxed than in the split part. Sort neighbours on a cost function when merging.  Cost function measures normal variation. More variation means more rough an costlier to encode.
        
Tries to represent clusters as hight field over bas plane.     
        
Density is the averahe distance to three nearest neighbours.
        
Points are projected to a rectangular plane. This plane is orthogonal to the cone and passes through the center of mass. The density is calculated and pixels on the grid are said to support the height field if they are within a factor of 1.5 from the mean distance. This is reprented as a binary mask. The height of a pixel is determined a its disance to the MLS surface},

In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and its meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of- the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies. I.},

@article{Shapovalov2010,
abstract = {The problem of laser scan analysis gained significant attention within the last decade. The standard approach to point cloud classification utilizes Markov Random Fields (MRF). Usually, a subclass of MRFs, Associative Markov Networks (AMNs), are used. In AMN the pairwise potential function is constant for a pair of different class labels. In some cases this constraint is too rigorous since it does not allow expressing some natural interactions between objects, such as roof is likely to be above the ground. In this work we use the general form of pairwise potentials instead. We show how to perform a tractable inference in such network using a message-passing based algorithm. Oversegmentation technique is used to subsample a scan; this helps to eliminate noise, improve efficiency and makes possible to use natural edge features. Experiments on two datasets obtained by an airborne laser scanner show that non-associative Markov networks usage leads to improvement in classification accuracy.},

abstract = {A procedure for both vertical canopy structure analysis and 3D single tree modelling based on Lidar point cloud is presented in this paper. The whole area of research is segmented into small study cells by a raster net. For each cell, a normalized point cloud whose point heights represent the absolute heights of the ground objects is generated from the original Lidar raw point cloud. The main tree canopy layers and the height ranges of the layers are detected according to a statistical analysis of the height distribution probability of the normalized raw points. For the 3D modelling of individual trees, individual trees are detected and delineated not only from the top canopy layer but also from the sub canopy layer. The normalized points are resampled into a local voxel space. A series of horizontal 2D projection images at the different height levels are then generated respect to the voxel space. Tree crown regions are detected from the projection images. Individual trees are then extracted by means of a pre-order forest traversal process through all the tree crown regions at the different height levels. Finally, 3D tree crown models of the extracted individual trees are reconstructed. With further analyses on the 3D models of individual tree crowns, important parameters such as crown height range, crown volume and crown contours at the different height levels can be derived.},

abstract = {Modern laser range scanning campaigns produce extremely large point clouds, and reconstructing a triangulated surface thus requires both out-of-core techniques and significant computational power. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of the moving least-squares (MLS) surface reconstruction technique. We believe this to be the first GPU-accelerated, out-of-core implementation of surface reconstruction that is suitable for laser range-scanned data. While several previous out-of-core approaches use a sweep-plane approach, we subdivide the space into cubic regions that are processed independently. This independence allows the algorithm to be parallelized using multiple GPUs, either in a single machine or a cluster. It also allows data sets with billions of point samples to be processed on a standard desktop PC. We show that our implementation is an order of magnitude faster than a CPU-based implementation when using a single GPU, and scales well to 8 GPUs.},
