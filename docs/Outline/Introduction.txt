Outline
-------


Motitavtion
	Point cloud cleaning is a manual and time consuming task.
	Big impact on zamani productivity
	Critique existng systems
		Proprientary
		Make open source
		Accelerated memory eficient algorithm to remove trees...
		GPU accelerations

	Improvements over simple manual systems

Goals
	Speed up cleaning by making it faster (than what?) and less manual while maintaining accuracy.
	(Is accuracy really important to mention? Surely if accuracy is compromised, it will simply require more manual effort to correct?)

Contributions
	* Evaluate usefullness of existing computer vision algorithms in the context of point cloud cleaning
	* Determine the effectiveness of modifications made to existing algorithms
	* Determine if mutual information can be used reduce labour


(Evaluation)
	Evaluate manual against automated in system
	Assest performance measures
		Memory & processing


Make sure arguement is solid.
Send before next weeks meeting.

Implement undo functionality
	Save state vs operations
