		Time users to 98% accuracy, why?
		Show picture

		In 2d view:
			Segment heinz with lasso tool (count lasso actions)
			Segmemt heinz with brush tool
			Select heinz with depth sensitve brush tool

		In 3d view: ask user to comment on tools
			Segment wall with lasso
			Segment wall with brush
			Segment wall with plane select

			Segment tree with lasso
			Segment tree with brush
			Segment tree from wall (isolated) in 10 seconds, measure accuracy

		Now use any tool that you want to segment tree
			Note down tools

		Many examples, sometimes it helps
