Speed up pointcloud cleaning
	Segmentation problem
		Segmentation is the partitioning of something into multiple partitions

	Segmentation of pointclouds

	Segmentation of range scans

	Segmentation of 3d images

	Semi automated segmentation
		User input drives the process


Many ways to skin segment a range scan
Techniques borrow from a bunch or areas

	Clustering
		Herarcical culstering
			Top down
			Bottom up
			0(n^3)
			Don't have to specify K
		K-means
			Need to specify K

	Region based segmentation
		...

	Edge based 2d (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_segmentation)
		Uses edge detection
			Canny...
		Snakes
			Fits model to edge


	
	Graph partitioning

	Classification

Semi-automated segmentation
	Graph cuts
	snakes



How does one evaluate segementations?
	Assume there is a ground truth
	Measure recognition and recall

----------
Clusting is to group similar data points together
	Aim can be to segment
	Distance metric required
	Does not work on catagorical or ordinal data
	Assumptions

Classification is to assign a predetermined class to data points
	Similar to clustering


Clustering
	Hierarcical
		Top down
		Bowttom up
		Split merge algorithms
	K-means clustering
		Limits
			Convex data


Classification
	


Problems
	Noise
	Incomplete data
	Non uniform data


Unsupervised"
	Find structures or patterns in data

Supervised
	Find relationships between input and output


How to segment complex objects

Objects vary in terms of complexity
	Trees
	Card
	Lamposts
	People

Objects are coherent
	Neighbours are likely to be of the same type


Clustering help find natural groups in large amounts of data
	Summarising data

	â€œCluster analysis organizes data by abstracting underlying structure either as a grouping of
	individuals or as a hierarchy of groups. The representation can then be investigated to see if
	the data group according to preconceived ideas or to suggest new experiments

 Jain and Dubes [JD88]:


Solving our problem we have many tools at our disposal



For our goals clustering is mainly for data simplifications
We must either classify clusters directly as one of our target objects or use them as an intermediate step in the segmentation process
