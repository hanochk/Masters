2d vs 3d, is one better than other?
 	qualitative
 	near vs far?
 	just cite away

does the depth sensitive brush tool provide a speed up?
 	time users doing segmentation
 	do quick user test segment things
 
does the plane tool provide speedup?
 	ask user to segment a target
 	do quick user test segment things

does the auto plane segment tool provide speed up?
	Too general, what if we isolate the region?

is the roll correction useful
	research on evaluation
	how to speed up navigtion in 3d scenes
	user friendly camera movement


sample size low and variance low, that is a good indicator

radius filter
	clear


Find wall
Find noisey wall

------------------------------------


Test data
	need things to segment

	things & manifestations

	wall, tree, ground, free starning object


Things to clean
	Objects
		isolated, embedded
		noisey, clearcut
		walls, trees, free standing objects
	Noise


Critical to user test:
	Reference segmentations
	Plugin to constantly provide accuracy info
	Tool to save camera position and orientation



Test brush tool:
	brush tool is good for embedded objects
	better than the lasso tool
	lasso tool selects the background

	Show that the depth correction makes segmentation faster
		segment wheel barrow in 2d
			with depth correct
			without depth correct

		segment heinz in 2d and 3d
			with depth correct
			without depth correct

	Show cases where it breaks down


Test plane tool:
	plane tool is good for quickly selecting planes

		Ask user to segment the wall at the demenja scene
			lasso
			brush
			plane select
		Ask user to segment the wall on my default scene
			lasso
			brush
			plane select

		possible to use all?


Test random forest tool:
	how that tool is useful to disabiguate thing

	open the deminja scan
		disambiguate the tree and house
	open the defaul scan
		disambiguate the wall from the tree


Test roll correction:
	show that roll correction supports quicker navigation as it avoids disorientation

		Open the deminja scene
			create disorientating position
			ask the user to navigate to the to the steps where the two people are

			ask on lickert scale if you felt less disorientated


		test if camera is in radius plugin
		mark target?



Mention time contraints
	Say how the automated tool could help
	Show how
	


Test user simulation:
	user needs to meet some accuracy
	count the number of vertices
	count the number of lasso invocations 
	time how long it takes to create a lasso

	segment heinz
	segment the tree thats easy to get from below
	segment wall

	dimensions: how complex the shape is
				how embedded its


2D vs 3D view
	ask users if 2d or 3d view makes more sense
	when is which one beneficial

Manual tests:
	Test global plane select tool:
		user testing would take to long
		inconclusive results are sure
		would be good for scenes with many planar surfaces


	Noise filter
		Cleans up systematic noise
		Not special
		Deals with non uniform density

	Get noisy scene
		filter with depth correction
		filter without depth correction

		find good case, average case, bad case
