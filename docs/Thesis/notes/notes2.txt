Clusting is to group similar data points together
	Aim can be to segment
	Distance metric required
	Does not work on catagorical or ordinal data
	Assumptions

Classification is to assign a predetermined class to data points
	Similar to clustering


Clustering
	Hierarcical
		Top down
		Bowttom up
		Split merge algorithms
	K-means clustering
		Limits
			Convex data


Classification
	


Problems
	Noise
	Incomplete data
	Non uniform data


Unsupervised"
	Find structures or patterns in data

Supervised
	Find relationships between input and output


How to segment complex objects

Objects vary in terms of complexity
	Trees
	Card
	Lamposts
	People

Objects are coherent
	Neighbours are likely to be of the same type


Clustering help find natural groups in large amounts of data
	Summarising data

	â€œCluster analysis organizes data by abstracting underlying structure either as a grouping of
	individuals or as a hierarchy of groups. The representation can then be investigated to see if
	the data group according to preconceived ideas or to suggest new experiments

 Jain and Dubes [JD88]:


Solving our problem we have many tools at our disposal



For our goals clustering is mainly for data simplifications
We must either classify clusters directly as one of our target objects or use them as an intermediate step in the segmentation process
