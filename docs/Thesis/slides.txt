Point cloud cleaning

Removing unwanted objects and noise
	- Trees
	- Cars
	- People
	- Mixed pixels

2000+ scans
up to 2 hours to clean a scan

Current tools:
	Noise filters
	Lasso tool

Ideally we would automate this

Trade off between automation and control

We propose a mix of high precision low automation tools and lower precision highly automated user driven tools

- Lasso
- Brush tool
	- Depth aware
- Planar flood fill
- Example based segmentation

How to programatically identify unwanted objects or noise


- Features
	- Local descriptor
	- e.g. X, Y, Z, I
	- Feature extraction is the process of transforming input features into new salient features
		- Point normals, PCA, Gradients
		- 2D & 3D features

- Clustering
	- Grouping of homogeneous points
	- Process
		- Feature selection
		- Similarity measure e g. Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance
		- Grouping algorithm
			- K-nearest neighbors
			- split & merge
		- Optional compact cluster representation
			- Centroid
			- Feature vector
			- Simplifies further processing

	- Coarser representation of the data
	- Clusters don't always correspond to objects of interest


- Classification
	- Problem of determining what class an observation belongs to given a set of characteristics
	- A classifier is a model used to solve a classification problem.
	- Construct model
		- Expert knowledge
			- Use human insights
		- Supervised learning
			- Learns from example data



Objects or noise can be found using a combination of features, clustering and classification.

Walls:
	We know they are flat.
	X, Y, Z, and intensity values are not directly useful
	Extract features
		Principal components
			- Points on a wall are generally distributed along two primary axis
		Point normals
			- On a flat surface point normals should point in the same direction

	Clustering solution:
		Feature vector: Nx, Ny, Nz
		Similarity measure: Euclidean distance
		Grouping algorithm:
			- Compute PCA for all points
			- Flat surfaces have a near 1:1 ratio of the largest components and a much smaller smallest component
			- Order candidate points according to flatness
			- clusters = []
			- for X in candidate_list
				- region = []
				- Add X to seed_list
				- for each point Y in seed_list:
					- neighborhood = find_neighboring_points(Z)
					- for each point Z in neighborhood:
						- if normal(X) - normal(Z) < threshold:
							- region.append(Z)
							- seed_list.append(Z)
