annote = {In general, minimise energy function

        
Energy function has a term for smoothness and how well the label fits the data

        
Smoothness is a usually a pairwise fuction. For p and q that are neighbours, penalty is associated when they are not the same.

        
Minimising this function is bloody expensive, also lots of local minima

        
...

        
Proven that global minimum is NP-Hard

        
Cost function are metric or semi metric.
Semi metric does nor obey the traingle inequality (3)
1. V(a,b) = 0 iff a = b
2. V(a,b)  = V(b,a)
3. V(a,b) <= V(a,y) + V(y,b) 

        

        
---------------

        
Standard moves where one pixel changes label, does not find good solutions due to local minimas.

        
Methods reviewed:
Itterative Conditional Modes - local minima

        
Simulated annealing - expensive to find global optimum, approximations are bad

        
Descrete relaxation labling methods

        
----------
Standard move: one pixel changes label
alpa-beta swap: apha points can change to beta lablings and vs versa
Alpha expansion: Points can only be relabled as aplha

        
Their graph algorithm finds optimal a-b swap or a-expansion

abstract = {With the advent of new, low-cost 3D sensing hardware such as the Kinect, and continued efforts in advanced point cloud processing, 3D perception gains more and more importance in robotics, as well as other fields. In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and its meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of- the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies. I.},

abstract = {Feature extraction is a central step of processing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. Existing detectors tend to exploit characteristics of specific environments: corners and lines from indoor (rectilinear) environments, and trees from outdoor environments. While these detectors work well in their intended environments, their performance in different environments can be poor. We describe a general purpose feature detector for both 2D and 3D LIDAR data that is applicable to virtually any environment. Our method adapts classic feature detection methods from the image processing literature, specifically the multi-scale Kanade-Tomasi corner detector. The resulting method is capable of identifying highly stable and repeatable features at a variety of spatial scales without knowledge of environment, and produces principled uncertainty estimates and corner descriptors at same time. We present results on both software simulation and standard datasets, including the 2D Victoria Park and Intel Research Center datasets, and the 3D MIT DARPA Urban Challenge dataset.},

label the feature vectors using a classifier trained on a set ofmanually labeled objects

find points of interest (high point densities)
cluster points
describe shape \& spatial context
classify them with svm

        
if the user can click on an object, then it does not have to be located

        
shape feature:
