abstract = {One approach to reducing the costs of usability testing is to facilitate the automatic detection of critical incidents: serious breakdowns in interaction that stand out during software use. This research evaluates the use of undo and erase events as indicators of critical incidents in Google SketchUp (a 3D-modeling application), measuring an indicator's usefulness by the numbers and types of usability problems discovered. We compared problems identified using undo and erase events to problems identified using the user-reported critical incident technique [Hartson and Castillo 1998]. In a within-subjects experiment with 35 participants, undo and erase episodes together revealed over 90\% of the problems rated as severe, several of which would not have been discovered by self-report alone. Moreover, problems found by all three methods were rated as significantly more severe than those identified by only a subset of methods. These results suggest that undo and erase events will serve as useful complements to user-reported critical incidents for low cost usability evaluation of creation-oriented applications like SketchUp.},

annote = {Range scanning involves two streams of processing. Geometry and surface appearance. Data between the two streams may be exchanged to improve quality and efficiency. In the end bith are combined inti a single description.

Hardware:
Can be considered a black box that produces cloud points. Scanner characteristic can be exploited however.

- Triangulation systems. Project light that is captured by a sensor. 3d positios are then calculated. Limitations: Line of sign between light source and sensor, surface properties.

-Time-of-flight. Round trip time for emited light to reflect. Allows for real time scanning, large distances (100m).

-Need to know about scanner:
Accuracy (how much error, error increases with distance), Precision varies accross the range image

- Resolution, Smallest distance between two points.

-Implicit information: No occluding surfaces along the ray. Range images are 2d arrays. Estimated surface normal can be calculated bu using the cross product from a point to its immediate neighbours. This helps to construct a surface more efficiently.

Registration:
Acurate tracking of orientation and position, turntabke (self occlusions, top and bottom problematic), interactive allignment (identify 3 points to calcuate rigid transform), hard to solve with no information (large parameter search space),

ICP used to refine initial allignment. It was proved that ICP converges at a local minimum, but may not find global minimum.

Surfaces with few features are problematic, Two cylindrical surfaces my slide without distance between correspondences changing. Intensity or coacquired texture images may help with this.

Identifying correspondence points may vary. Euclidian distance, point to plane (less sensitive to non uniform sampling, allows smooth surfaces to slide), point to projection.

Point on the first surface can be uniformly subsampled, or seleted by identifying surface features.

Zang filters pairings by using a maximum tollerable distance and orientation consistency.

Dorai checks error variance bewteen neigbouring points to prune incompatible matches.

Compute the rotation matrix. This is a non linear minimisation problem? (cannot be solved in closed form, [be sure what this means]). This can be solved by linearising the rotation matrix by using small rotations. Also Quarterions and SVG.

Multiple registration:
Pair wise errors accumulate = bad.
Skeleton and align other to it.

One view selected as main. Othe views registered to it. Itterated until incremental views are stable in terms of their incremental roattion matrix

Does pairwise resgistartion. Bad correspondences are then discarded. All the scans are then itterated over to distrute the error in overlapping scans within some threshold.

Simultanious registration takes bloody long. can be optimised with a resolution heirarchy.

Using textures to aid registration:
Coincidently captured. Texture can be registered to the range image. Textures can add features and be of higher resolution. Can be projected onto the geometric model.

Texture can be used to assist operator with initial allignment.

Automatic initial allignment by using 2d image features.

Texture used to refine allignment. Good when raster image has higher resolution. Colours are used as coordinates or matching operations are used.

Line of sight error:
Elipsoid gaussian error produced by scanner, Outliers produced by reflections and such. Depth error is the primary concern.

Better statistical reconsruction from two estimates. Overlapping data resampled.

Scan integration:
Merge alligned scans into a non redundant representation.

Problems: Noisy data, outliers, missing sections, variations in sampling density

Range scans vs point clouds

Delaunay-based methods assume no structure and uses a convex hull type operation to extract a surface. Sensitive to noise.

Surface based methods:

Greedy approach, local parameterisation

Zippering: mesh range scans and then remove redundant traingles

Ball pivoting, 2d delauney upgarded to 3d

Surface based methods are efficient but robustness issues arise with noise

Volumetric Methods: 
Calulate 3d grid with distances to the surface. Find zero set. 

Voxel to surface distance along ray. Voxel to closest point on consensus surface (average surface)

Distance to delaunay traingulation. 

Good for large data sets apparently. Voxel size need to be optimally selected. Memory use need to be taken into account. Octree instead of regular grid could help. Good for water tight models as it tends to fill holes.

Deformable surfaces: Initial approximation \& relaxation

Solid model such as a circle with virtual springs

Post processing:

Addapt final model after intergration.

Mesh simplification: reduce complexity

Texturise. Parameterize surface with respect to 2nd surface. Use mid mapping

Texture:
Colour is percieved by humans depending on illumnatiion
Finish is a product of the objects reflective properties

Register texture by generating synthetic binary image by projecting it to guessed camera position. Improve guess by minimising error.},

abstract = {After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push-relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

@article{Canny1986,
abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

---------------
Segment regions of interest that contain a high about on muliple echos

For segmented regions shape description features are calculated smallest eigenvalue is below 0.05 or the ratio of the smallest is below 0.01 the cluster is labeled non-vegetation.

Regions are afterwards classified according to the features into vegetation and non-vegetation

Segments identified with two pass algorithm
One: label pixel with neigbour's label
Two: ensure lable the same as connected component

Features
-------------
Inspired by Reitberger et al. [4],

Histogram of point densities (10cm horisontal slices)
Histogram is a shape desciptor of a tree

Histogram of eigenvalues. Smallest eigen value is an estimator of planarity.
Trees should be volumetric

Alternative fast classifier is the ratio of the two smallest eigenvalues. Rough class predictor.

@book{Gamma1995,
abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. 0201633612B07092001},

abstract = {This tutorial focuses on establishing an intuitive visual understanding of the relationship between ordinary 3D rotations and their quaternion representations. We begin building this intuition by showing how quaternion-like properties appear and can be exploited even in 2D space. Quater- nions are then introduced in several alternative representations that do not necessarily require ab- stract mathematical constructs for their visualization. We then proceed to develop visualizations of quaternion applications such as orientation splines; streamlines; and optimal orientation frames. Finally; for the strong-hearted; we briefly discuss the problem of generalizing quaternion concepts to higher dimensions using Clifford algebras.},

abstract = {A central theme in the study of animal navigation has been the extent to which it requires the formation of an internal representation of space, the so-called ‘cognitive map’. Although its properties remain disputed, it is now generally accepted that a map-like representations exists in the brain, and neurobiological studies, conducted in tandem with behavioural investigations, have done much to elucidate the neural substrate of the map as it operates in two dimensions. However, little is known about how it encodes real-world, three-dimensional space. The present chapter uses recent neurobiological and behavioural findings to explore this question. It will be argued that the navigational problems in three dimensions are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from those in two, and evidence will be reviewed suggesting that – perhaps for this reason – horizontal and vertical space are processed separately in the vertebrate brain. The possible adaptive consequences of such an anisotropic encoding scheme are outlined.},

We describe a general purpose feature detector for both 2D and 3D LIDAR data that is applicable to virtually any environment. Our method adapts classic feature detection methods from the image processing literature, specifically the multi-scale Kanade-Tomasi corner detector. The resulting method is capable of identifying highly stable and repeatable features at a variety of spatial scales without knowledge of environment, and produces principled uncertainty estimates and corner descriptors at same time. We present results on both software simulation and standard datasets, including the 2D Victoria Park and Intel Research Center datasets, and the 3D MIT DARPA Urban Challenge dataset.},

abstract = {On the basis of measured receptive field profiles and spatial frequency tuning characteristics of simple cortical cells, it can be concluded that the representation of an image in the visual cortex must involve both spatial and spatial frequency variables. In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition.},

abstract = {Modern laser range scanning campaigns produce extremely large point clouds, and reconstructing a triangulated surface thus requires both out-of-core techniques and significant computational power. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of the moving least-squares (MLS) surface reconstruction technique. We believe this to be the first GPU-accelerated, out-of-core implementation of surface reconstruction that is suitable for laser range-scanned data. While several previous out-of-core approaches use a sweep-plane approach, we subdivide the space into cubic regions that are processed independently. This independence allows the algorithm to be parallelized using multiple GPUs, either in a single machine or a cluster. It also allows data sets with billions of point samples to be processed on a standard desktop PC. We show that our implementation is an order of magnitude faster than a CPU-based implementation when using a single GPU, and scales well to 8 GPUs.},

Neighbourhood graph is set up by joining clusters for which one of its points have another cluster's points in its k=5 nearest neighbours. Neighbouring clusters are then merged based on a normal cone metric of the union of two neighbours. It is a bit more relaxed than in the split part. Sort neighbours on a cost function when merging. Cost function measures normal variation. More variation means more rough an costlier to encode.

Tries to represent clusters as hight field over bas plane. 

Density is the averahe distance to three nearest neighbours.

Points are projected to a rectangular plane. This plane is orthogonal to the cone and passes through the center of mass. The density is calculated and pixels on the grid are said to support the height field if they are within a factor of 1.5 from the mean distance. This is reprented as a binary mask. The height of a pixel is determined a its disance to the MLS surface},

abstract = {The approximation of arbitrary two-dimensional curves by polygons is an importanttechnique in image processing. For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small—but not minimum—number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive.},

Goal:
    Segment single trees in a forest
Input:
    Lidar
    full wave form
        X Y Z I W
        I = Maximum amplitude
        W = Pulse width
    Aerial scans of forest
    Interpret as height map
    10-25 points/m2

        
Method:
    Watershed segmentation -> canopy height model
    Local maxima are good estimates where the stems are
    Stems found via heirarchical clustering below the crown base
    Reconstruct stems with ransac
    Normalised cut segmentation segment single trees

        
Insight:
    Trees move and have holes in leaves, pulses thus have variance

        
Results:
    watershed only 48pct detection
    stem detection +4 pct
    n-cut 11-17pct improvemnet

        
    works well with leaves on or off
    5-11pct false positive
    upper: 80pct accuracy
    mid: 20-30pct
    lower: 5-25pct

        
Comment
    The advantage of full waveform LIDAR data is that, basically, each reflection can be detected by the waveform decomposition.

        
    We make use of a modern laser range finder capability to measure multiple echoes per laser pulse via Full Wave Analysis. $\backslash$cite\{Elseberg2011\}

        
    Good intro on full wave form
    Graph cut works well for seperating trees lower and mid levels
    Combine 2D watershed with 3D graph cut
    Normalised cuts are a graph partitioning algorithm
    Watershed works on height maps, find the natural divide between two local minima
    You can assign minimas
    Intensity is the maximum amplitude of the returned pulse

        
    \% additional information on the reflecting characteristics of the forest structure like branches and stems

        
Applicable:
    We are not trying to segment trees from each other, we are trying to segment not just trees from structures.

PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and its meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of- the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation.

abstract = {The problem of laser scan analysis gained significant attention within the last decade. The standard approach to point cloud classification utilizes Markov Random Fields (MRF). Usually, a subclass of MRFs, Associative Markov Networks (AMNs), are used. In AMN the pairwise potential function is constant for a pair of different class labels. In some cases this constraint is too rigorous since it does not allow expressing some natural interactions between objects, such as roof is likely to be above the ground. In this work we use the general form of pairwise potentials instead. We show how to perform a tractable inference in such network using a message-passing based algorithm. Oversegmentation technique is used to subsample a scan; this helps to eliminate noise, improve efficiency and makes possible to use natural edge features. Experiments on two datasets obtained by an airborne laser scanner show that non-associative Markov networks usage leads to improvement in classification accuracy.},

abstract = {Sampling complex, real-world geometry with range scanning devices almost always yields imperfect surface samplings. These "holes" in the surface are commonly filled with a smooth patch that conforms with the boundary. We introduce a context-based method: the characteristics of the given surface are analyzed, and the hole is iteratively filled by copying patches from valid regions of the given surface. In particular, the method needs to determine best matching patches, and then, fit imported patches by aligning them with the surrounding surface. The completion process works top down, where details refine intermediate coarser approximations. To align an imported patch with the existing surface, we apply a rigid transformation followed by an iterative closest point procedure with non-rigid transformations. The surface is essentially treated as a point set, and local implicit approximations aid in measuring the similarity between two point set patches.

Objects constist of sufaces that are not necessarity flat, and edges that are not necesarily straight.

PCA used to determine if the point is an edge or surface. Use the ratio between eigenvalues to classify point.

Result is a graph where vertices represent surfaces and edges while edges represent adjacancy.

Adjacancy is determined when there is are two points from different sements that fall in the same neighbourhoodset but are of different types.

Sparse grid use to speed up neighbourhood queries

abstract = {A procedure for both vertical canopy structure analysis and 3D single tree modelling based on Lidar point cloud is presented in this paper. The whole area of research is segmented into small study cells by a raster net. For each cell, a normalized point cloud whose point heights represent the absolute heights of the ground objects is generated from the original Lidar raw point cloud. The main tree canopy layers and the height ranges of the layers are detected according to a statistical analysis of the height distribution probability of the normalized raw points. For the 3D modelling of individual trees, individual trees are detected and delineated not only from the top canopy layer but also from the sub canopy layer. The normalized points are resampled into a local voxel space. A series of horizontal 2D projection images at the different height levels are then generated respect to the voxel space. Tree crown regions are detected from the projection images. Individual trees are then extracted by means of a pre-order forest traversal process through all the tree crown regions at the different height levels. Finally, 3D tree crown models of the extracted individual trees are reconstructed. With further analyses on the 3D models of individual tree crowns, important parameters such as crown height range, crown volume and crown contours at the different height levels can be derived.},
