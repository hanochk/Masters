On way is to use a lot of features like curvature, stdev of normals, intensity distribution and use together with a classifier such as ANN (probably bad) or Suport Vector Machines

I need to create a tool to highlight points in a diff.

Could click on a tree or make a rough selection using a rectangular box or cylinder. Use mouse wheel to change Z coordinate.

Use many steps
    1. Find the ground plane
    2. Distribution of Z coordinates
    3. Many features for each point (computationally intense)
    4. Classify only medoid (point closest to all points in cluster)


Supervised learning algorithms:
    SVM
    AdaBoost
    Random forest

Problem is that is only airborn scans
Very low resolution
Errors still present

I will take a more local approach vs global.
High premium on accuracy
Vegetation
Random objects

Proposal:

What are graph cuts?

Could normalise the cloud and then apply cleaning to corresponding regions in the unclened cloud
Could morphology work?

Detect what you want and subtract from that.
make mini clusters with the same density
    maybe: is it a solid?
    
Can use feature distace to limit clustering


What if semantic labels are applied to isolated points before cleaning
