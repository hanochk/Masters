Problem with depth maps are that missing data creates edges.
Missing data can be interpolated but we run the risk of not finding valid edges.

Algorithm for interpolating missing data.

For each missing datapoint, find 8 neighbours.
	Calculate mean.

No wait... Lets find a noise estimate in the area instead.

For each valid point, calculate the stddev.
