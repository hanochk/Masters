Background
	Cultural heritage preservation
		Zamani project
		CyArk Project

	Laser scanning
		Processing pipeline
			Data aquisition
				Time of flight scanners
				Triangulation
				Structure from motion

				Scanner resolution keeps increasing
				Non uniform density
				Data: xyz, rgb, i, gps location


			Registration
				2.5D to full 3D
				Itterative closest points
					Needs close alignment
			
			Cleaning
				Time consuming
				Classification task
					No points are modified
				Focus on interactivity and accuracy
				Manual vs automated
				Cleaning before or after registration

			Surface reconstruction (Mention)
			Hole filling (Mention)
			Texturing (Mention)


	Cleaning
		Existing systems
			Z&Y
			Cyclone
			Meshlab
			Pointools
			VR Mesh Studio
			Carlson Pointcloud
			3D Reshaper
			Terrascan

		Evaluation of existing systems
			None of the automated methods work well for trees

			Proprietary with the exception of Meshlab

	How to find trees
		Point features
			Normals
				Ways of performing normal estimation
					Neighbour search
						KD Trees
						Scan grid
					Cost vs Quality
					Dealing with noise

				Basic building block for other features
			Fast point feature histograms (FPFH)
				Good discrimination for primitive geometric objects
				Costly to calcutale

			Principle components
				Good for finding edges and planes
				Solves part of the inverse problem


		Region growing
			Grow neighbourhood from seedpoint
			Add neighbour if satisfies criteria
				Similarity of features
				Distance

		K-means clustering
			Problems with non uniform denisty

		Graph cuts
			Binary classification
			Encode point similatity edges
			Shown to work well with arbitrary objects
			Results dependend parameters.

		Machine learning
			Support vector machines
		 	Markov models
		 	Probalistic graphical models
		 	Conditional random fields


	Evaluation of literature
		FPFH seems to discriminate well for primitive geometry. Might be a useful featature to use in tree classification.

		Machine learning has been used to classify vegitation. It however requires training and classified datasets are rare. Possibility to train a classifier on the on scans in the application. Unpredictable accuracy.

		Graph cuts have been shown be effective for automated object classification. Augmented with more edge information accuracty may be improved with minimal user interaction.
