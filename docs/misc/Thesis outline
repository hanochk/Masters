	Point cloud cleaning a binary point classification problem. Distinguishing between desirable and undesirable objects or artefacts in a scene.

	Such a classification can be performed by either by man or machine. It can hard to codify which points are desirable and which are not. However, some cleaning problems are amendable to simple heuristics.

	Ways of classifying noise:
		Sonar clouds, biggest blob is the ocean surface.
		Land surveys, whats a house whats trees, markov models
		



	Traits of existing solutions:
		Degree of automation
		Computation required
		Degree of skill required
		Paralallisable
		Difficulty of problem
		Accuracy required
		Problem type
		2.5 vs 3D


	What is the most effective way to clean cloud noise.
		Speed - How fast can a scan be cleaned
		Accuracy - How accurate are results
		Skill - Low skills, more people can do it, less money

	What can new methods bring to the table:
		Graph cuts
		Noise metric


	Classification can be sol
