	Point cloud cleaning a binary point classification problem. Distinguishing between desirable and undesirable objects or artefacts in a scene.

	Such a classification can be performed by either by hand or automatically. It can hard to codify which points are desirable and which are not. However, some cleaning problems are amendable to simple heuristics.

	General processing pipeline

	Existing systems (industry mostly)
		Where does it fit in

	(Look into 2d segmentation methods)

	Ways of classifying point clouds:
		Heuristic
			Clustering
			Graph based
				Min Cut
				Normalised cut
			Feature based
				FPFH
				Normals
				Spin images
				Principle components (Spina)
			Filters
				Distance from source
				Density
				Isolated points

		Machine learning
			Markov models
			SVM
			Conditional random fields

		Manual
			2D vs 3D perspective
			Lasso, brush, floodfill, etc


	UX background (to do)
		Incude industry stuff




	Sonar clouds, biggest blob is the ocean surface.
	Land surveys, whats a house whats trees, markov models
	Lidar clustering
		

	Segmentation algorithms/methods:
		Voxel based
		Graph based

		...

	Types of data:
		2.5D and merged 3d


	Taxonomy of existing solutions:
		Degree of automation
		Computation required
		Degree of skill required
		Paralallisable
		Difficulty of problem
		Accuracy required
		Problem type
		2.5 vs 3D
		Realtime
		Simplicity (of use?)

	What is the most effective way to clean cloud noise.
		Speed - How fast can a scan be cleaned
		Accuracy - How accurate are results
		Skill - Low skills, more people can do it, less money

	What can new methods bring to the table:
		Graph cuts
		Noise metric


	Classification can be sol
