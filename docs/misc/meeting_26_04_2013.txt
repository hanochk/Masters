color clouds

Background:
	graph guts
	multiple scans

	worth starting because its tedious

	start looking at background outline
		bullet list of background
		seperate high levek stuff from chapter specific background

	exsititing systems
		Intro and background


	Background what other people have done.

		Segmentation methods
			Methods:
				Markov
				Features
				Region growing

			What is it
			Its braod
			Many types of datasets
				We only look at pointsets

			How am I different from other methods
				Fodus on trees

			Scanners
				Technical background on scanners
				Density variation
				Reflectance
				Normal estimation
				Colour

				Finding a survey paper on scanners
					Laser scanners and what you get from them

				Point out that scanners changed over the years
				Medium range
				Short range
				Long ranges

			Pointfeatures

			Mention things that you may or may have not tried.

			Method seems promising.... but
				Not well suited to ...

			Graph based segmentation methods


			At the end:
				Do a taxonomy of the methods
				Categories to compare them on

				Score them

				No method will be good at everything...
				So try X


				I did not just arrive at graph cuts randomly:
					How did I get there?
					What is the logic
					It was the most likely to be succesful
					Has to score them correctly


			Background:
				What did I look at?
				Why was graph cuts reasonable to look at?
				People wanna see i used graph cuts for a reason

				Taxonomy: no clearcut winner maybe?

Flesh out other stuff
Put bullet points where unsure



UI
	What fuctionality should be there?
	Look at other software
	Find whats common and so it famiiar
	Also fair evaluation
	Base on Zamani: Keen on 2d view

Evaluation
	

When you have all the information in a reseasonal for
	Sent patrick a draft.

Flesh out as far as I can in 2 weeks.
	AHHHHHH!
