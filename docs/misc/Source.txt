Name: On the Segmentation of 3D LIDAR Point Clouds
Year: 2011
Authors: 
--------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
	This study has proposed a set of segmentation methods designed for various densities of 3D point clouds. It first pro- vided empirical evidence of the benefit of ground extraction prior to object segmentation in the context of dense data. The Cluster-All method has achieved the best trade off in terms of simplicity, accuracy and computation times. Its limitations were shown in the context of sparse data and two novel segmentation techniques were proposed for the latter case: the GP-INSAC algorithm for probabilistic ground modeling and for the processing of any 3D point cloud sparse or dense, potentially formed of data accumulated from several sensors; a Mesh Based technique, optimised for the processing of range images. All the algorithms were evaluated on several
	sets of hand labeled data using two novel metrics.

				- explores unsupervised probabilistic segmentation in in which the FH [10]algorithm is modified for range images and provides an over-segmentation during pre-processing. Segmentation is cast into a probabilistic inference process in two graphs modeled as Conditional Random Fields: one graph is used to segment in the range space and another graph is used to segment in feature space (built from 3D features such as Spin Images). The evaluation does not involve ground truth data.

			Schoenberg et al. [13] & Strom et al. [15]
				have applied the FH algorithm to coloured 3D data obtained from a coregistered camera laser pair.


			Schoenberg et al. [13]
				Up-sample range data using the technique in [3] to obtain a depth value for each image pixel. The weights on the image graph are computed as a weighted combination of Euclidean distances, pixel intensity differences and angles between surface normals estimated at each 3D point. The FH algorithm is run on the image graph to provide the final 3D partitioning. The evaluation is done on road segments only, while the evaluation proposed here is performed on entirely hand labeled scans.

			Strom et al. [15]
				propose a similar approach in which the FH algorithm is modified to integrate angle differences between surface normals in addition to differences in colour values. It is applied to a 3D graph built from a laser scan in which longer edges are disregarded. Segmentation evaluation is done visually without ground truth data.

				A maximum spanning tree approach to the segmentation of 3D point clouds is proposed in. Graph nodes represent Gaussian ellipsoids playing the role of geometric primitives. The merging of ellipsoids during the growing of the tree is based on one of the two distance metrics proposed by the authors, each producing a different segmentation “style”. The resulting segmentation is similar to a super voxel type of partitioning (by analogy to super pixels in vision) with voxels of ellipsoidal shapes and various sizes.

				Various methods focus on explicitly modeling the notion of surface discontinuity. Melkumyan defines discontinuities based on acute angles and longer links in a 3D mesh built from range data.


			Moosman et al. [9]
				use the notion of con- vexity in a terrain mesh as a separator between objects
